Triple Top Pattern

What is a Triple Top Pattern?

A triple top pattern is a bearish technical signal characterized by three peaks of approximately equal height on a price chart. This pattern typically emerges after a strong uptrend, indicating a potential trend reversal to the downside, also known as a bearish trend. The reason for this reversal lies in the fact that the price has attempted multiple times to surpass the peak but has failed due to insufficient buying interest at that price level.

Identifying a Triple Top

Observe three distinct peaks of nearly identical height on the price chart.
Ensure that these peaks follow a clear uptrend.
Draw a horizontal line across all three peaks to determine the resistance level.


The resistance level represents the price that must be breached for the asset to continue rising. If the price fails to break this level, it is likely to trend downward.



Trading a Triple Top Pattern

When trading a triple top pattern:

- Consider entering a short position (selling with the intention to buy back) only when the price breaks through the support level, signaling the completion of the pattern and a potential price decline.
- Look for strong trading volume accompanying the price drop to confirm the reversal. Weak volume may result in an unexpected price movement.







Triple Bottom Pattern

What is a Triple Bottom Pattern?

Conversely, a triple bottom pattern is a bullish technical indicator characterized by three troughs of similar height on a price chart. This pattern emerges after a strong downtrend, suggesting a potential trend reversal to the upside, known as a bullish trend. In this case, the price has attempted multiple times to fall further but is supported by a consistent level of demand, preventing it from declining.

Identifying a Triple Bottom

Look for three distinct troughs of approximately equal depth on the price chart.
Ensure that these troughs follow a clear downtrend.
When these conditions are met, it indicates that buyers are stepping in to prevent further price declines, creating a strong support level

Trading a Triple Bottom Pattern

When trading a triple bottom pattern:

- Consider entering a long position (buying with the intention to sell at a higher price) when the price rises above the resistance line.
- Confirm the trend reversal by monitoring trading volume. A significant increase in volume can validate the upward movement.


Triple top and triple bottom patterns are valuable tools for traders, as they provide insights into potential trend reversals. These patterns reflect the dynamic interplay between buyers and sellers in the market and can be highly profitable when identified correctly. However, it's essential to remember that they can be challenging to spot early on and may transform into different patterns if not fully formed.
